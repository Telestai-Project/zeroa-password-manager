# Zeroa Password Manager

**Zeroa** is an **open-source**, **experimental password manager** that allows users to encrypt and decrypt their password vault using a BIP-39 seed phrase from any blockchain wallet (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). This project explores a decentralized, cryptographic approach to password management, providing an innovative solution for securing your vault with blockchain-derived seed phrases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Status

Zeroa is currently in the **experimental phase** and **not ready for production use**. We are actively developing the core features, and the security model is still evolving. **We invite crypto developers, cryptographers, and blockchain enthusiasts** to join us in refining and enhancing this project.

> **Note:** This password manager is actively being produced by **Telestai**.

## üöÄ Features

- **BIP-39 Seed Encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt your password vault using any BIP-39 compatible seed phrase.
- **Simple Local Storage**: Passwords are securely encrypted and stored locally on your device.
- **Minimal UI**: Intuitive user interface for adding, viewing, and deleting passwords.
- **Blockchain Focused**: Built with crypto enthusiasts in mind, leveraging the blockchain ecosystem for encryption.
- **Open-Source**: Fully open for anyone to contribute and improve.

### Coming Soon:
- **Cross-Device Password Recovery**: We're working on enabling secure password vault restoration using your seed phrase across multiple devices. This is a key feature in progress, and we invite contributions from the community.
